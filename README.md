# AICA: AI-powered Cell Annotation
AICA (AI-powered Cell Annotation) is an R function that leverages large language models (LLMs) to provide automated annotation for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. This tool analyzes differentially expressed genes and uses advanced LLM models (like DeepSeek) to intelligently identify cell types or tissue regions.
